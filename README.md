# Capstone-Project-Deep-Learning-Analysis-of-Brain-Pathologies
Segmentation of MRI Brain Images with brain tumors and strokes

The purpose of this project is to use deep learning techniques to determine
whether brain pathologies are present in patient magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) images and to determine which parts of the brain are affected by disease
by localizing the abnormalities, i.e. segmentation of the images. Specifically,
MRI images from patients with brain tumors affecting the glial cells of the brain
which can be classified as high-grade (HGG) with a poor prognosis or low-grade
(LGG) with a better prognosis will be considered. Additionally, patient MRIâ€™s
with brain lesions caused by ischemic stroke will be analyzed.
